For over a decade, users and organizations have designed various types of solutions to achieve this. Though, many of these solutions were done manually or were using third party software, mostly open source, to automate and integrate various architectures."},{"when":{"day":"Friday","startTime":"2022-07-29T16:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-29T17:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/voting-solutions-all-people","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"372","width":"340","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/Screen%20Shot%202022-04-09%20at%2010.31.54%20AM.png"},"location":"Los Angeles C","speaker_id":["10152"],"speakers":["Aman Bhullar"],"title":"Voting Solutions for All People","topic":"Open Government","abstract":"Los Angeles County has developed a voting system to replace older Inkavote systems. This new system brings many new innovations to voting, including extended voting for ten days ahead of voting day, allowing voters to use any Vote Center in LA county to vote rather than being limited to a single polling place, an interactive ballot, electronic ballots, and a new tally system. This system was used in the 2020 primary and presidential elections, and plans are under way to open source the entire project.
