      "abstract": "Kubernetes is a proven, industry-accepted platform for running stateful workloads. Today, large-scale data is in HDFS, and workloads are facing challenges in seamlessly moving towards containerized K8s due to gaps in running big data on K8s. Many users are looking for solutions that could help to separate storage and computing. This migration will help users adapt to a next-gen solution. In this talk, we will share how Cloudera is pioneering the path toward K8s from Hadoop with open-source technologies around resource management and multi-tenancy architecture."
