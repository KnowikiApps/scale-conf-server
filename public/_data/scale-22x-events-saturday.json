In this talk, Solomon Hykes, creator of Docker and co-founder of Dagger.io, takes us on a journey through time, as we retrace the history of software’s industrial revolution, and explore the ramifications of the AI revolution for our community."

Developers continue to innovate by providing new sources of useful data that inspire creative new projects. In this talk, Addison Hart, a reverse engineer and data scientist with experience in geospatial, video game APIs and many others, will talk about what he has learned about making APIs, both from operating them and picking apart existing ones while reverse engineering. He will discuss API latency, quantity, coverage and quality and how these 4 aspects contribute to an APIs effectiveness."

A binary package is an archive, like a tarball plus metadata that includes the package name, version, depends, etc. and often {pre,post}-install, and post-removal scripts - for ldconfig, creating symlinks, or updating a database. Even a small oversight can prevent installation via dependency hell or file conflicts, break apt/dnf/zypper, or even corrupt the repository. This talk will cover the experience as a .deb and .rpm package and repo maintainer, debug common package manager errors and how to solve them."

This session will present my trials and tribulations attempting to use it to initially to track an arduino project through to ending up with industry manufactured boards and custom 3d printed housings. Failures surely will abound so that you can learn through the pain of others."

As the number of models increases, we need methods to compare their clinical usefulness. While some R packages exist to leverage GPU capabilities, Pytorch is by far more used for GPU computation. In contrast, R is efficient for data management and visualization. How should one build robust and reproducible pipelines incorporating them both ? My answer is well-designed pipelines with Docker, Makefile, and Elasticsearch. In this talk I will showcase my design approaches to such challenges."

Over the years, we have found extreme value in being able to use Exemplars for other things such as making tail sampling decisions, enriching alerts with sample traces and finally serving longer term Exemplars out of our tracestore built on top of ClickHouse. In this talk, we discuss how metrics and traces go hand in hand through the concept of Exemplars."

We propose Linux Virtualization Based Security (LVBS), a security feature that can a) harden the kernel and b) ensure that critical kernel resources remain untampered, even if the kernel gets compromised. VBS uses virtualization and the hypervisor to create a more privileged, isolated virtual environment, called Virtual Trust Level 1 (VTL1). VTL1 has its own kernel where a number of security solutions are hosted."

      "topic": "General",
      "abstract": "Wait, so you're saying adding more GPUs to a problem won't automatically speed things up? In this talk, I will present how enterprise datacenters, HPC shops, and home lab workflows can benefit from using multi GPU computing. Examples from computational fluid dynamics and AI/ML will highlight how leveraging multiple GPUs can reduce time to solution, and improve scalability for large, multidimensional domains. Attendees will gain insights into science's interest in GPU computing, problem decomposition, scaling to multiple GPUs, and code optimization with multiple GPUs in mind."

      "topic": "Kernel & Low Level Systems",
      "abstract": "Linux networking is multi-component, complex and hard to undestand. This session explains the internals of Linux networking by following the lifetime of a packet recieving and sending. The session will expain the fundamental concepts of Linux networking and will explains the role of the NIC drivers, packet buffers , IRQ handlers and how they interact with the Linux network stack and the userspace programs. The session aims to help Linux engineeers understand and make the right decisions with respect to Linux Networking"
