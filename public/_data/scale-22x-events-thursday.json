In this session, we will discuss how to properly monitor your OpenStack cluster, separating real-world failures from software bugs as well as how to market your cloud engineering work to nontechnical parts of the business."

If you've ever looked up at the sky and wondered if it's possible to use the Nix C++ interface to cache Flake inputs in-memory, this is the talk for you. If not, come along anyway!"

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating human-like text. Yet, their knowledge is limited by black-box training data, they are prone to hallucinations, and they often lack domain-specific knowledge. Here, we propose two architectures integrating domain knowledge about drug side effects into a Llama 3-8B Language Model through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG."
