Traditional DevOps metrics are start, but they may not be enough to measure DevEx. To get a better view into the value of DevEx, let’s look at measurements and returns in aggregate. In this talk, Michael Stahnke, co-author of the State of DevOps Report from 2018-2021, will share engineering metrics that truly work to validate that your DevEx program is delivering a positive return. We'll delve into metrics that work for individuals, teams, and departments."

A second distinction is between jobs of predictable duration that don't block versus tasks of long duration.   Attendees will learn how to use bpf tools  and new kworker monitors to observe and adjust workqueues, softirqs and tasklets."

Along the way I took a crash course in stepper motors and 3D design. The result is Tempus Nectit: a clock that documented 2023. \n \n Come along as I explain how I made a Linux-powered clock that knits a scarf throughout the year."

Multiple model versions were created, with Model Version 6 achieving a 95% confidence level in identifying stop signs. The study observes lower confidence levels as susceptible to cyber attacks. This demonstrates the ability to recognize anomalies, providing insights into performance variations across datasets. The success of Model Version 6 highlights the potential of advanced computer vision models for autonomous vehicle safety."

Here, the Descheduler plays the role of an efficient manager, the NPD acts as the problem finder, and the Autoscaler balances the cluster's size. Together, they detect, remove, and maintain the right scale of the cluster."
