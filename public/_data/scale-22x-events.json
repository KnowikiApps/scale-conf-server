Normally you'd rent out a tiny portion of a server stack in a building somewhere, paying per month for a server plan, but that doesn't have to be the case. Any device with even a little bit of computing power and access to the internet can be converted into a server, like that old office desktop sitting around just waiting to be dumped. The goal of this session is to talk about the differences between a LAN and a WAN, how servers work, and ultimately provide the knowledge and tools necessary to make your own home server from scratch."

Currently, while there is a local eval cache, evaluation costs are sum up locally but also globally as eval caches are generally not shared across machine or user boundaries. In other places such as searching packages, evaluation is impossible, prohibitively expensive, or just annoying. In this talk I want to introduce different approaches to avoid evaluations, how they are motivated and what their limits are."

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating human-like text. Yet, their knowledge is limited by black-box training data, they are prone to hallucinations, and they often lack domain-specific knowledge. Here, we propose two architectures integrating domain knowledge about drug side effects into a Llama 3-8B Language Model through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG."

Sandstone is a new tool to plan Haskell builds using Nix that achieves full incrementality without affecting eval times at all. It does this by using the new experimental \"dynamic derivations\" to create fine-grained build steps without involving the Nix language *at all*. We hope that Sandstone will kick of a new era of language-specific tooling using Nix!"

Especially if your applications were developed without RLS in mind and you use a single app user to connect to the database, it's impossible to use RLS in any meaningful way. In this talk, we'll look at possible ways to roll out RLS that can let you take advantage of this powerful feature in the real world."

      "abstract": "Accurate job classification is essential for understanding labor market trends and informing policy decisions, but modern job descriptions are complex and varied. We explore how open-source AI tools like PyTorch and HuggingFace models can improve mappings of Standard Occupational Classification to job descriptions. Using these technologies, we develop methods to better interpret and classify unstructured job data, leading to more precise occupational analysis. Join us to learn how open-source AI can enhance workforce analytics and how you can apply these tools in your own projects."

This session explores how AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming observability by automating data analysis, detecting anomalies, streamlining interactions, and supporting post-incident learning. Through real-world examples, we’ll see how AI-driven observability uncovers hidden patterns, reduces false alarms, and accelerates correlation discovery, enabling faster, more accurate issue resolution and a clearer understanding"

In contrast, R is efficient for data management and visualization. How should one build robust and reproducible pipelines incorporating them both ? My answer is well-designed pipelines with Docker, Makefile, and Elasticsearch. In this talk I will showcase my design approaches to such challenges."

VBS uses virtualization and the hypervisor to create a more privileged, isolated virtual environment, called Virtual Trust Level 1 (VTL1). VTL1 has its own kernel where a number of security solutions are hosted."

By opening specific ports on a router, users expose their internal network to threats such as unauthorized access and cyberattacks, as attackers often scan for open ports to exploit vulnerabilities. misconfigurations during the setup process can lead to further security breaches and network instability. With the availability of safer alternatives like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and cloud services, the need for port forwarding diminishes."

This talk discusses how to set up Nextcloud and configure Linux and Mac desktops and iOS mobile devices to use it, especially convenient if your household isn't 100% Linux (or 100% Mac)."

This makes them an attractive API to use from Rust, but exposing this API requires interacting with all levels of the kernel stack: from the build system and linker all the way to arch-specific optimizations and runtime allocation of new per-CPU variables. This talk is intended for an audience that is broadly familiar with kernel primatives and synchronization issues but entirely new to Rust."

Football teams have the ultimate defense in depth strategy that can be studied to build a stronger application security program. By understanding the parallels between maintaining secure code and football defense, developers can continue to create and maintain secure open source software. No prior knowledge about football or application security is required."
