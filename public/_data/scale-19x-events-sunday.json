Most efforts, in spite of significant resources and financial investment, are very fragmented, not openly shared, only address part of the challenges, and are not collaborative with those outside of a single organization or very few partnerships. We have to approach this differently in order to yield different results. We must drive diversity and inclusion as an open source community, utilizing relevant data and building on existing research and initiatives."},{"when":{"day":"Sunday","startTime":"2022-07-31T11:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-31T12:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/are-we-being-inclusive-our-community-recognitions","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"724","width":"499","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/Headshot%202.png"},"location":"Carmel","speaker_id":["5948"],"speakers":["Ray Paik"],"title":"Are we being inclusive with our community recognitions? ","topic":"General","abstract":"Inclusiveness is vital for strengthening the sense of belonging. Community recognition thus needs to be more inclusive so that all community members, regardless of their background, interests, and skillset feel appreciated. Traditional recognition in open source tends to emphasize contributions in project repositories (or code), and we often miss valuable contributions from non-developers. Ray will share his experience finding different contributions, community recognition examples (both good & bad), and feedback he received on community recognition programs over the years."},{"when":{"day":"Sunday","startTime":"2022-07-31T11:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-31T12:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/lost-art-database-design","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"1420","width":"1586","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/matt_yonkovit_compressed.png"},"location":"Bel Air","speaker_id":["9882"],"speakers":["Matt Yonkovit"],"title":"The Lost Art of Database Design","topic":"General","abstract":"In today's rapid pace development cycles, the database design is often overlooked or even dismissed entirely."},{"when":{"day":"Sunday","startTime":"2022-07-31T11:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-31T12:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/network-visibility-heart-modern-monitoring","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"2096","width":"1397","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/jeffG_headshot_epic_small.jpg"},"location":"Marina","speaker_id":["4106"],"speakers":["Jeff Gehlbach"],"title":"Network Visibility: The Heart of Modern Monitoring","topic":"Observability","abstract":"Regardless of the operational parameters and deployment models of the apps and services that power your organization, all modern applications depend on the network to deliver. The NetFlow family of protocols and their cloud equivalents play an important role in understanding how your  workloads interact with the network, and how those interactions impact user experience.Â  In this session we will dive into what flows are, how to interpret them to gain visibility, and how some real organizations have benefited from these insights by leveraging an entirely open-source monitoring stack."},{"when":{"day":"Sunday","startTime":"2022-07-31T11:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-31T12:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/5-ways-manage-your-infrastructure-code-scale","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"2113","width":"2182","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/Sean.jpg"},"location":"Los Angeles AB","speaker_id":["10224"],"speakers":["Sean O'Dell"],"title":"5 ways to manage your Infrastructure as Code at Scale","topic":"Developer","abstract":"The introduction of Infrastructure as Code or IaC has transformed how you can provision and deploy high-performance cloud-based IT infrastructures. IaC tools, such as Terraform, have been integrated into DevOps toolchains, saving DevOps teams from the excessive manual effort. While these tools undoubtedly help accelerate building IT infrastructures, their limitations can impact DevOps ability to optimize and improve control of their IaC processes, supporting future business needs. This talk will discuss strategies and tooling that alleviate some of those limitations."},{"when":{"day":"Sunday","startTime":"2022-07-31T11:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-31T12:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/engaging-students-customized-linux-images-cybersecurity-training","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"2361","width":"1446","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/atomr.JPG"},"location":"Century CD","speaker_id":["10056","10068"],"speakers":["Atom Ramirez","Marie Ramirez"],"title":"Engaging Students with Customized Linux Images for Cybersecurity Training","topic":"Security","abstract":"Training Middle School and High Schools students in cyber security can be a challenging task especially with engaging students and keeping them on task.

Thereâs less of a latency budget than you think. Measuring delays from network requests and browser operations are necessary but they do not tell the whole performance story.
