Along the way I took a crash course in stepper motors and 3D design. The result is Tempus Nectit: a clock that documented 2023. \n \n Come along as I explain how I made a Linux-powered clock that knits a scarf throughout the year."

These so-called \"Apple Silicon Macs\" can't run Linux... or can't they? \n \n With tight collaboration with the Asahi Linux project, the Fedora Asahi SIG have produced the Fedora Asahi Remix to allow people to run Fedora Linux on these new Macs. This presentation introduces the Fedora Asahi SIG and discusses the journey to supporting Fedora Linux for these new Macs."

For the more experienced, you’ll be able to relate these concepts to your own real world examples. I was a Theatre major not a CS major so we’ll approach this from a language perspective not a math perspective."
