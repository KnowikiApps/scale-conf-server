In conjunction with Tetra Bio Distributed, USC developed the Fitra, a simple open source 3D printable respirator accessory that improved the quantitative fit of two N95 respirators on many of the 38 test volunteers. While not used by the hospital, we believe this device can help those looking for improved fit for their respirators."},{"when":{"day":"Saturday","startTime":"2022-07-30T16:30:00-07:00","endTime":"2022-07-30T17:30:00-07:00"},"url":"/scale/19x/presentations/overcoming-imposter-syndrome-become-conference-speaker","photo":{"alt":null,"height":"1320","width":"1150","src":"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/speakers/dawn_May_2021_sq.jpg"},"location":"Carmel","speaker_id":["386"],"speakers":["Dawn Foster"],"title":"Overcoming Imposter Syndrome to Become a Conference Speaker!","topic":"General","abstract":"The goal of this talk is to provide some resources to help everyone feel included and welcome as a conference speaker.

One such form that is relatively lesser known is tiling window management. In this style users need not manage windows that stack upon and occlude one another. Rather, windows are each allotted a region of the screen and by default all windows are visible. Side-stepping the mouse-driven workflows of more prevalent desktops, tiling interfaces provide for simpler and faster keyboard-driven interaction."}]}
