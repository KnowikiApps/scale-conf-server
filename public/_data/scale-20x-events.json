Teams adopting K8s soon find they need to go beyond the stock resource types like Deployments and Services and build their own.  This requires extending the control plane via custom controllers. Students taking this workshop will write Golang code to develop custom API resources, implement the controller lifecycle, error handling, testing, operational concerns such as metrics and logging, leader election, and status handling."

Come learn about how powerful and useful arrays can be in your daily PostgreSQL development."

As an enterprise-grade open source technology designed for scale, it can be hard to find ways to use Kubernetes to understand it ourselves. So let's explore it with something a little more approachable - cookies! Through this fun, hand-illustrated analogy, you'll learn about the value Kubernetes provides as a container orchestrator - running applications at scale, and how it does this valuable work with tools like pods, deployments, services, and scheduling!"

While it is frequently used in large and complex situations, many prospective users feel it is therefore too large or complex for their needs. If you're just starting a new project, or even maybe a new startup, should you use Kubernetes? I say yes! Newer tools like K3s which allow building minimalist environments have made it much easier to run in a \"I just want some containers\" mode. This opens the door to starting on a small Kubernetes setup and being able to slowly grow it over time as your requirements and complexity increase."

We will share an approach to help cut through “paralysis through analysis” and choose the most important metrics and their optimal thresholds to achieve organizational results. This approach can help provide some guidance on correlating performance to business metrics like bounced sessions, conversion rates, search engine rankings, etc."

There are pros and cons to packaging for RPM-based and Debian-based distributions. This talk will discuss the rationale, our experiences working in two very different ecosystems, and lessons learned."

In hindsight, this was a part of the beginning of what later evolved into \"developer productivity\". That evolution took 20 years, and is still in the making. I saw this up close, first at an OSS project (Jenkins), then at a vendor (CloudBees), and now at a different company (Launchable). I'd like to share what I saw in this journey, how developer productivity evolved, and where it's going. I'd like to show you different teams I've come across, who are at different stages."
