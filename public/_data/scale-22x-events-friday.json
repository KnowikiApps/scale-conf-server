This addresses a major blocker in the adoption of flakes."

Sandstone is a new tool to plan Haskell builds using Nix that achieves full incrementality without affecting eval times at all. It does this by using the new experimental \"dynamic derivations\" to create fine-grained build steps without involving the Nix language *at all*. We hope that Sandstone will kick of a new era of language-specific tooling using Nix!"

Especially if your applications were developed without RLS in mind and you use a single app user to connect to the database, it's impossible to use RLS in any meaningful way. In this talk, we'll look at possible ways to roll out RLS that can let you take advantage of this powerful feature in the real world."
