Teams adopting K8s soon find they need to go beyond the stock resource types like Deployments and Services and build their own.  This requires extending the control plane via custom controllers. Students taking this workshop will write Golang code to develop custom API resources, implement the controller lifecycle, error handling, testing, operational concerns such as metrics and logging, leader election, and status handling."

We’ll deploy some microservices to explore Istio’s features, like automatic timeouts and retries. We’ll also look at the powerful observability features, automatic service-to-service mutual TLS, and more!"

There are some challenges that are specific to Gentoo, such as supporting multiple Python releases at once."

Among modern databases, however, only PostgreSQL has dedicated datatypes, functions, and indexes built to efficiently work with arrays. In fact, I think arrays are a hidden superpower of PostgreSQL, fully utilized as a data type, usable in pl/pgSQL, and essential for a myriad of built-in functions to process data more efficiently. Come learn about how powerful and useful arrays can be in your daily PostgreSQL development."

Alternatively, if have an existing PostgreSQL workload and wanted to extend this to support JSON use cases, this session is for you! Postgres has had JSON support for a while but with recent versions, Postgres now handles JSON really well. In this session, I cover the benefits of using JSON, anti-patterns to avoid, and an example of how to use JSON in Postgres."
