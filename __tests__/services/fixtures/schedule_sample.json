Maven is a very flexible build tool that evolved over the past 15+ years using strict processes for semantic versioning. However, tagging in today's diverse release ecosystem benefits from lightweight process. While many software stacks leverage Maven's strict semantics, its legacy release process withered under large, modern codebases. We demonstrate a faster Maven build and tag approach thanks to recent software improvements that promote a modern no-release-plugin workflow.",
